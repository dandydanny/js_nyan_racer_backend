game = Game.create
player = Player.create(....)
player.games << Game.create

How do I:
Create players with their initials? p = Player.create(initials: "DL")
Create a game? g = Game.create(title: "MyGame1")
Save race results (winner, laptime)?

How do I:
Get the winner of a game? Game.find_by_id(1).winner
Get the laptime of a game? Game.find_by_id(1).laptime
Get a list of players who participated in a game?
Get a list of games a player participated in?
Get player's initials based on their ID?

WInner and laptime: inheritant to game?
should be in join table?

Active record - needs temp var.

Game.create(something: :something_else)
Game.create("something" => "something")

game.players.build
